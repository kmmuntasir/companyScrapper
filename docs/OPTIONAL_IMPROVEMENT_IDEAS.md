Some optional improvements for the task:

- Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of the application. This will help to ensure that the application is 
  always up-to-date and that any changes are deployed in a consistent and reliable way.
- Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across the application servers. This will help to improve the performance of 
  the application and ensure that it can handle a large number of requests.
- Use a monitoring system to track the performance of the application. This will help to identify any problems early on 
  and take corrective action before they impact users.
- Use a logging system to collect and store all the application's logs. This will help you to troubleshoot problems and
  understand how the application is being used.
- Use a security scanner to scan the application for vulnerabilities. This will help to protect the application from 
  attack.

Some additional suggestions for the bonus features:

- Make the search bar case-insensitive. This will make it easier for users to find the data they are looking for.
- Allow users to search by multiple criteria, such as company name, registration code, or turnover. This will give users 
  more flexibility when searching for data.
- Implement autocomplete for the search bar. This will help users to quickly find the data they are looking for.
- Allow users to export the data to a CSV or JSON file. This will make it easier for users to use the data in other 
  applications.
